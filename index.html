            <p class="post-exerpt"><ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03564" target="_blank"><cite>QuickSync: A Quickly Synchronizing PoS-Based Blockchain Protocol</cite></a><a href="https://semion.io/doc/quicksync-a-quickly-synchronizing-pos-based-blockchain-protocol" target="_blank">[Semion.io]</a><br>
        <p>The authors present <i>QuickSync</i>, a Proof-of-Stake blockchain consensus protocol based on Ouroboros[<a href="#ref-6">6</a>]. The authors claim Byzantine resistance against an adversary with up to 50% stake and also performance improvements. The paper also contains proofs for both the liveness and persistence of this protocol.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03199" target="_blank"><cite>Enabling Cross-chain Transactions: A Decentralized Cryptocurrency Exchange Protocol</cite></a><a href="https://semion.io/doc/enabling-cross-chain-transactions-a-decentralized-cryptocurrency-exchange-protocol" target="_blank">[Semion.io]</a><br>
        <p>The authors propose a decentralised <i>cross</i>-cryptocurrency exchange, motivated by trading Bitcoins for other cryptocurrencies. The authors implement a prototype as a DApp running on an Ethereum testnet.</p>
        <p>This paper is particularly interesting to me for two main reasons. Firstly, given my current research - both personal and coursework-related - into DExes and other DeFi platforms. Secondly, my interest in projects such as <i>tBTC</i>[<a href="#ref-7">7</a>]</p>
    </li>

        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09252" target="_blank"><cite>MemShield: GPU-assisted software memory encryption</cite></a><a href="https://semion.io/doc/memshield-gpu-assisted-software-memory-encryption" target="_blank">[Semion.io]</a><br>
        <p>The authors propose <i>MemShield</i>, a framework for transparently encrypting primary memory to resist cold boot attacks. <i>MemShield</i> is implemented as a C library that interacts with <code>userfaultfd</code> to monitor for page requests from userspace. This system allows page-level granularity for memory protection.</p>
        <p>Cold boot attacks have always fascinated me, so mitigations against them are of particular interest as well. I'm impressed by both the granularity and compatibility of this project: <i>no changes to existing applications are required</i>.</p>

        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01261" target="_blank"><cite>Formal Verification of Solidity contracts in Event-B</cite></a><a href="https://semion.io/doc/formal-verification-of-solidity-contracts-in-event-b" target="_blank">[Semion.io]</a><br>
        <p>The authors define a subset of Solidity which can then be translated into Event-B - a modelling framework of which I have never heard of until discovering this paper. The authors assert that this greatly helps in the formal verification of Ethereum smart contracts.</p>
        <p>Recent coursework that I'm undertaking has required me to study different testing methodologies for Ethereum smart contracts. So far, this has only involved two categories: symbolic execution and fuzzing. This paper expands on the formal verification route - a category which I haven't covered in depth yet.</p>

        <p>Admittedly, I included this simply due to the spectacular title. Doesn't it just sound cool?</p>

        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01865" target="_blank"><cite>JaxNet: Scalable Blockchain Network</cite></a><a href="https://semion.io/doc/jaxnet-scalable-blockchain-network" target="_blank">[Semion.io]</a><br>
        <p>The authors propose a novel design for a scalable, decentralised Proof-of-Work blockchain, called <i>JaxNet</i>. Their design uses a network of parallel chains that rewards miners for their computational effort in maintaining the network.</p>
        <p>This problem obviously garners an incredible amount of attention - both in academia and industry. Any new publications on the matter seem worthy of a mention.</p>
